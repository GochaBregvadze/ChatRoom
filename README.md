# ChatRoom
Giorgi Nakani and Gocha Bregvadze worked on that project.
------------------------------------------------------------------

The title of the work is chatRoom and it is already clear what type of application we are dealing with.
The app is connected to Google Firebase, which allows us to save various user accounts with the help of
authentication. A realtime database is also used, which allows us to correspond in real time. Every 
account has a unique ID,making it impossible to duplicate data. You only have the ability to
correspond in the app, it is simply simple and convenient.
